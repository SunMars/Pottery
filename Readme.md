A replica of the ["Hand Grasp and Motion for Intent Expression in Mid-Air Virtual Pottery" paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2788900) from the Graphics Interface Conference 2015, Canada. See a commented [video description](https://youtu.be/gun453zMNgU) for a quick overview.

## Used Hard- and Software

### [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/)
The Leap Motion controller is a small USB peripheral device which is designed to be placed on a physical desktop, facing upward. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, to a distance of about 1 meter. The LEDs generate pattern-less IR light and the cameras generate almost 300 frames per second of reflected data, which is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion controller software using "complex maths" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.

### [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/)
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies and used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices and websites.
